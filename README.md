PepsiKirby: The Very Hungry Coordinate Simulation
Project Overview

Welcome to the PepsiKirby Initiative. This is a high-performance, block-based mathematical environment designed to simulate the metabolic needs of Lepidoptera (caterpillars). While it may look like a world made of blocks, it is actually a complex 3D grid for calculating the volume of digital food sources and environmental structures.
Educational Objectives

    Volumetric Analysis: Calculating how many cubic units it takes to build a scale model of a giant fruit.

    Structural Integrity: Testing why sand and gravel respond to gravity while other geological blocks remain suspended in the coordinate plane.

    Biological Probability: Observing survival rates when a simulated caterpillar encounters a high-temperature lava pocket.

The Code of Conduct: Standard Academic Protocol

To ensure this remains a VERY AWESOME LEARNING GAME, all researchers must follow the Anti-Distraction protocol. Any user caught violating these rules will be removed from the simulation for the remainder of the period.

    Thou shall not say Deez Nuts: This is a workspace for high-level math. Personal nut jokes are considered a breach of scientific integrity.

    Thou shall not say Imposter or Sus: We are here to calculate geometry. If you find something suspicious, it shall be referred to as a Statistical Anomaly.

    Prohibited Slang: Terms such as Skibidi or Rizz are strictly forbidden. These words cause immediate frame-rate drops and intellectual damage to the simulation.

    The Caterpillar Rule: If you see a green creature that hisses, that is a Spicy Caterpillar. Do not attempt to interact with it. It is a test of your Rapid Evacuation Skills.
